# QR Code Generator API

This project is a Node.js and Express-based web service that provides two main functionalities for generating QR codes:

1. **Generate QR Code as PNG:**  An API endpoint that takes a text input, generates a QR code from it, saves the QR code as a PNG image on the server, and returns the file path.
2. **Generate QR Code as Base64:** An API endpoint that takes a text input, generates a QR code from it, and returns the QR code as a Base64-encoded string, which can be easily used in web applications.
